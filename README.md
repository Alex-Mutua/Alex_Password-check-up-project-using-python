# Alex_Password-check-up-project-using-python
In this project have written a function to determine if a password is good. A good password is at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. The function should take the password as its only parameter and return True if the password meets all these criteria, otherwise False
